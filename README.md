# Forecasting

Forecasting is the process of making predictions of the future based on past and present data and most commonly by analysis of trends. Forecasting methods:-

If there are no data available, or if the data available are not relevant to the forecasts, then qualitative forecasting methods must be used.
Quantitative forecasting can be applied when two conditions are satisfied: a) numerical information about the past is available b) it is reasonable to assume that some aspects of the past patterns will continue into the future. Forecasting model building methods:-
Linear model
Exponential model
Quadratic model
Additive seasonality
Additive seasonality with quadratic trend
Multiplicative Seasonality
Data Used :
